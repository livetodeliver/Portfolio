                <div class='about-width'>
                    <p>Before the days of Cascading Style Sheets, Facebook and even MySpace, my dad&rsquo;s passion for computers became contagious and as a pre-teen I began creating my own websites.  I used it as a way to connect with the world far beyond my bedroom walls. Now, many years later, I have resparked that adolescent fire I had for web development and have found myself drawn back to coding as a place where my passion for learning something new is constantly fed.</p>
                    <p>I have a solid working grasp of HTML, CSS and Javascript, some experience in action with jQuery and Flexbox, and am currently working on new projects with React.js.  I am also beginning to dabble in the backend with Node.js, Postgres and MongoDB.  Iâ€™d love to learn other technologies such as Ruby on Rails, AWS, and Sass, but really am willing to dive full on into any stack utilizing the tools needed to do the best job possible. </p>
                </div>
                <div class='about-width'>
                    <p>I'm searching for a thriving workplace where I can bring my positive energy, knowledge and skills to a strong and diverse team.  I would love to be in a environment that encourages authenticity, learning, and growth.</p>
                    <p>When not tapping away at computer keys I can be found curled up with a good fantasy novel, crafting a new batch of artisan soap, or simply spending some quality time hanging out with my partner and our furry family  (2 dogs, 3 cats).</p>
                    <p>I am also in love with <a id='gritty' href="https://twitter.com/GrittyNHL">Gritty</a>, The Philadelphia Flyers mascot, and you probably should be, too. </p>

            <h3>Vegan-Friendly PHL App</h3>
            <p>This app utilizes the VegGuide.org Rest API, Google Maps API, and Google Places API to find vegan and vegan-friendly restaurant locations within the Philadelphia area. Users have the ability to select certain search paramaters to filter results, and then are given a map that can display the location for a selected result entry. Users may choose to search by distance based on a given address, by selected neighbhorhood from a dropdown menu, or simply just do a blanket search for any vegan-friendly restaurants in Philadelphia that meet their other selected criteria.</p>
