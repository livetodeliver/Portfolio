                <div class='about-width'>
                    <p>Before the days of Facebook, HTML5, and even MySpace, my dad&rsquo;s passion for computers became contagious and as a pre-teen I began creating my own websites.  I used it as a way to connect with the world far beyond my bedroom walls. Now, many years later, I have resparked that adolescent fire I had for web development and have found myself drawn back to coding as a place where my passion for learning something new is constantly fed.</p>
                    <p>I'm searching for a thriving workplace where I can bring my positive energy, knowledge and skills to a strong and diverse team.  I would love to be in a environment that encourages authenticity, learning, and growth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='about-width'>
                    <p>When not tapping away at computer keys I can be found doing a myriad of activities such as  “Bookstagramming,” learning pointed pen calligraphy, artisan soapmaking, vegan cooking, snuggling with my furry family (2 dogs, 3 cats), and maybe even doing something physical like a long bike ride, or a rowing class.</p>
                    <p>I am also in love with <a href="https://twitter.com/GrittyNHL">Gritty</a>, The Philadelphia Flyers mascot, and you probably should be, too. </p>

            <h3>Vegan-Friendly PHL App</h3>
            <p>This app utilizes the VegGuide.org Rest API, Google Maps API, and Google Places API to find vegan and vegan-friendly restaurant locations within the Philadelphia area. Users have the ability to select certain search paramaters to filter results, and then are given a map that can display the location for a selected result entry. Users may choose to search by distance based on a given address, by selected neighbhorhood from a dropdown menu, or simply just do a blanket search for any vegan-friendly restaurants in Philadelphia that meet their other selected criteria.</p>
